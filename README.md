# Destiny Mod Thing

## What is this nonsense?

There's a bunch of armour mods in Destiny 2. They do a lot of things. That there's a lot of them and that they do a lot of things makes it hard to think about them all.

This is a codification of all the mods in a (relatively) consistent YAML format, as well as validators for that data.

The upshot of this is that it'll be possible to look at all the mods and think about how to build ... builds ... for your Destiny 2 armour and play desires.
